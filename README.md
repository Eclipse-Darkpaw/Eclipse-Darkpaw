# About Me
Hi, I'm Autumn, a discord bot programmer with about 4 years of experience in python under my belt. Currently, my biggest project is my seven bots found in Eclipse-Darkpaw/Echo. They are the result of over three years of programming and learning how to work with python. I've learned so much with the bots and am still learning a lot from them (like the importance of proper documentation). The bots are the best way for me to tell I'm improving my skills at all, ~~since they're the only project I haven't completely abandoned.~~ My latest development is a system that detects and deletes scam messages in discord servers, and alerts when its unsure of the message at hand.

Currently, I'm working towards A Cybersecurity Analytics degree, with a focus in Forensic science.
