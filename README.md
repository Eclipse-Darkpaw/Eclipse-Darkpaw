# About Me
Hi, I'm Autumn, a discord bot programmer with about a year and half of experience in python under my belt. Currently, my biggest project is my three bots found in Eclipse-Darkpaw/Echo. They are the result of over a year and half of programming and learning how to work with python. I've learned so much with the bots and am still learning a lot from them (like the importance of proper documentation). The bots are the best way for me to tell I'm improving my skills at all, ~~since they're the only project I haven't completely abandoned.~~

Currently, I'm working towards A computer science and mathematics degree, with a focus in Cybersecurity and encryption.
